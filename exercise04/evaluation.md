Which kind of 'not easy' ?



## Algorithm and Implementation
* nice pseudo-code

| complexity of O(1) for removing objects we use a HashMap

wouldn't a linked-list do the same trick? Do nodes need to be removed, actually?

* good that you implemented the Grid idea (even if it has still a bug)

| Changing the direction of the path then has running time O( m/4 )

one could think of a doubly-linked list that can change direction by just flipping a switch. Just a weird idea, that you don't need to implement...

## Experimental Evaluation

* well done
* Figure 1 could use some scaling up. It's hard to see any important trends
* Figure 2 is much better
* Figure 3 is a bit too much. 
* nice graphics. The Luxemburg case is very instructive, as it shows the emergence of order from chaos .. kind of ;-)

## Conclusion

* plausible. Good that you interpreted the effects of the Grid.


# 3. Code & Test Cases
* nice readme (but why do you need heavyweight tools like maven?)
* have you considered JUnit for test cases? Would be convenient for both, you and me.
* outputting an svg is very effective, too

# 4. Assessment
Pass
